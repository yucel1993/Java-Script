## Instructions

The game is very easy to play. Just follow these steps:

- The game randomly generates a secret number between 1 and 10.
- The player's task is to guess the number by entering their guess in the input field.
- After each guess, the game gives the player feedback on whether their guess was too high or too low.
- If the player correctly guesses the number, the game ends and the player wins.
- If the player runs out of guesses, the game ends and the player loses.
- The game also shows the number of remaining tries of the player. The tries start at 3 and decrease by one with each incorrect guess.
