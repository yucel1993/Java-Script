The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
The rules are as follows: Scissors cuts Paper, Paper covers Rock, Rock crushes Scissors. If both players choose the same option, it's a draw.
The score is displayed at the top of the screen. Each win earns you one point, each loss costs you one point, and each draw doesn't affect your score.
